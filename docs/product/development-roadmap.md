# Electra — Development roadmap

The detailed scope and evidence live in [Flutter delivery plan](flutter-delivery-plan.md).
Current delivery branch: `feat/flutter-routing-cablerun`.
Delivery is incremental: each baseline has an exact-commit Flutter/core CI gate.

| Milestone | Outcome | Status |
|---|---|---|
| FL0–2 | Flutter, SQLite, project/floor/room hierarchy | Implemented foundation |
| FL3–6 | Geometry kernel, room editor, surface navigation, component placement | Baseline closed |
| FL7–8 | Explicit electrical loads, circuits and design current | Baseline closed |
| FL9–11 | Surface routes, CableRun, junctions and floor topology | Baseline closed |
| FL12–13 | Dependency recalculation, protection requirements and normative catalog | Baseline closed |
| FL14 | Manufacturer catalogs, strict matching and preserved SKU selections | Baseline closed |
| FL15 | Generate panel structure from consumption groups; incoming protection, phase/reserve proposal | Baseline closed |
| FL16 | Enclosure and DIN-row layout, terminals/ducts/zones, module/mm capacity checks | Next |
| FL17 | Traceable BOM by project/floor/room/system and manufacturer mapping | Planned |
| FL18 | Versioned price books and labor/material estimates | Planned |
| FL19 | Offline PDF reports: drawings, schedules, BOM/estimate and engineering evidence | Planned |
| FL20 | Offline installation, deviations/as-built, tests and commissioning evidence | Planned |

## Next vertical acceptance: FL16

The editor reports module/mm overflow and represents the exact physical row arrangement of a generated panel.
Recommended enclosure width, height and depth must account for device dimensions, DIN rails, terminals, cable ducts, clearances and reserved space.
FL15 already supplies preliminary occupied/spare/total module capacity. This is not a physical enclosure dimension.
Normative requirements, manufacturer selection and physical placement remain separate concerns.

## Parallel baseline extensions

- shared room placement transforms, measured floor geometry, inter-room segments and risers;
- complete verified regulatory datasets by jurisdiction and edition, plus additional protection roles/criteria;
- sourced manufacturer datasets and vendor import adapters; no fabricated SKU specifications;
- device-port binding, physical channel fill/capacity and fuller cable/protection coordination;
- complete decision history, broader discipline support and larger-project rendering/performance.

These extensions have separate acceptance criteria. Baseline closure does not claim that all future domain capabilities are complete.

## Validation at FL15

Engineering implementation gate: `af08e7bba4094bd96b5650fafc175cc7e2deddaf`.
58 mobile tests and 102 pure-Dart core tests; format, Drift generation and analyzers passed.
Final branch-head commits are checked by the same CI workflow.
FL15 baseline: one generated panel per floor, common explicit outgoing protection conditions and preserved proposals; detailed boundaries are in the delivery plan.
